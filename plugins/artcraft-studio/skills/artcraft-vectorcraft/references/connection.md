CLI：`D:\artcraft\vectorcraft\VectorCraft\vectorcraft-cli.exe`

实测版本信息：见项目 evidence/discovery.json。插件根目录 runtime.json 中 `vectorcraft` 的 command/args 是实际启动配置。网关 `artcraft_session(app="vectorcraft", action="close")` 会终止该应用的 headless 会话；先保存，再修改配置，再重新调用以启动新会话。其他应用不受影响。

vectorcraft-cli — VectorCraft automation

USAGE:
  vectorcraft-cli mcp [--connect ADDR | --headless] [--automation-read-root DIR]... [--automation-write-root DIR]...
      Run the MCP server on stdio. Default: connect to a running app at 127.0.0.1:7979
      (vectorcraft --control 7979), falling back to a headless in-process session.
      --automation-read-root / --automation-write-root confine the files the agent's commands read
      (open, place, relink, library loads…) and write (save, export, package, library saves…) to
      DIR, links followed; each may be given more than once, a path inside any of its folders being
      allowed, and a kind left out grants none of its access. They imply --headless: a running app
      enforces its own (vectorcraft --control PORT --automation-read-root DIR …).

  vectorcraft-cli run [--in FILE] [--cmd ID [--params JSON] | --commands FILE|-]... [--export FILE]... [--scale N] [--ppi N]
      Headless batch: open FILE (any readable format) or start a new document, run commands in
      order, export each FILE in the format its extension picks (see Writable formats; a .ait FILE
      is a template, written as file.saveAsTemplate writes it). Raster exports use the document's
      raster effects resolution unless --scale (pixels per point) or --ppi (pixels per inch, wins
      over --scale) is given; other formats leave them out. Prints one JSON result per step.
      --commands reads steps from FILE, or from standard input for -, where it stands among the
      --cmd and --export steps: a JSON array of {"command": ID, "params": {...}} (or "id" for
      "command"), or one such object per line (JSON Lines), at most 64 MiB and 100000 steps.
      Errors name the step, counting from 0 as "$N" references do.

  vectorcraft-cli commands
      Print the command catalogue as JSON.

  vectorcraft-cli convert IN OUT [--scale N] [--ppi N] [--artboard I | --range R] [--outline-text] [--decimals N] [--replace-lossy] [--editing-data] [--preserve-editing] [--ai-version 7|pdf] [--hidden-objects layer|omit|visible] [--transparent-images flatten|omit]
      Open IN (any readable format) and export OUT in the format its extension picks (see Writable
      formats). Raster resolution: --ppi, else 72 times --scale, else the document's raster effects
      resolution; other formats leave them out. --artboard is 0-based, --range 1-based ("1-3,5"); a PDF gets every artboard
      unless one of them is given, EPS the bounds of the art, the other formats the first artboard.
      A .ait OUT is a template of every artboard, written as file.saveAsTemplate writes it (not with
      --artboard or --range).
      Live effects are kept, and hidden layers and objects (written hidden in SVG and PSD), with
      SVG's data-* attributes; --outline-text writes SVG text as paths, --decimals sets SVG's coordinate
      precision (1–7, default 3). OUT may not be IN when reading
      IN left things out (hidden text, art or layers it could not read; the notes say which) unless
      --replace-lossy is given. --editing-data opens a .ai or an EPS with editing data from its editing copy
      even where that draws differently from its PDF part or page (which can be older), as long as
      it can be read. A PDF OUT omits the embedded native document unless --preserve-editing is
      given (the app's Save As PDF still defaults to keeping it). With --preserve-editing, when the
      attachment is written the result's warnings say so (it is left out, with its own warning, for
      --artboard or a --range without every artboard).
      The result has the export's warnings, and importWarnings for what reading IN left out.
      --ai-version 7 writes a .ai as the legacy version 7 (layers, groups and type kept; one file
      per artboard, OUT-<artboard>.ai when there are several; default pdf, PDF-compatible), with
      --hidden-objects (default layer: a hidden layer above each layer's hidden objects; omit;
      visible), --transparent-images (default flatten, with the art under them; omit) and
      --outline-text (type as outlines instead of text).

  vectorcraft-cli info FILE
      Print a JSON summary: the import warnings (what didn't come in as it was, such as an EPS
      read from its preview and why), title, colour mode, units, artboards, object counts by
      kind, fonts.

  vectorcraft-cli bench FILE [--size WxH] [--iters N]
      Render FILE (any readable format) fitted to WxH (default 2880x1800) and print ms per frame
      (warm), multithreaded and single-threaded.

  vectorcraft-cli perf [--paths N] [--deep]
      Check the performance budgets (render, pan, hit test, save/load, SVG, Pathfinder, handle
      and segment drags) on a synthetic N-path document (default 50000). Exits non-zero if a
      budget is exceeded, unless the report says the machine is busy. --deep also times work with
      no budget yet and prints memory use (the working set on Windows), with the peak so far on
      Windows and Linux.

可见窗口联动：仅用户需要时，按帮助用应用 exe 的 --control 启动明确的回环端口，使用匹配的 CLI --connect / --bridge / --attach。不要猜测统一端口或参数。PhotoCraft 可要求控制令牌；不要把令牌写入 skill 或聊天。带 roots 的 headless 配置通常与附着模式互斥，限制应在 GUI 启动时设置并核对。
